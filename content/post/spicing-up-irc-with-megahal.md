I released [POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::MegaHAL)
the other day, a [POE::Component::IRC](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?POE::Component::IRC)
plugin for the esteemed and humorous conversation simulator known as
[MegaHAL](http://megahal.alioth.debian.org/). This makes it very easy to add a
MegaHAL brain to an IRC bot. I wrote one and fed him IRC logs of a channel
that I frequent, then let him loose online (he's a "he" because the IRC logs
primarily include ramblings from male users). Some examples of his brilliance
follow.

    <failo> Or maybe it's about sexual liberation and not perl & python.
    <failo> Yes, printing passport photos at home is surely a sign of a flock of aids infected prisoners with big sloppy dicks.
    <failo> I heard failo is a fact of evolution that cannot be shown because it looks like he knows what electricity is
    <failo> Fucking get your cock out and jerk each other off in proportion to how much dexter's wedding dinner is going your way
    <failo> Sir you had me at "balls."
    <failo> Every porn dvd has a "grill setting"
    <failo> So only 2% of americans also believe that the government is composed of thong-wearing oiled-up muscle boys.
    <failo> Increased struggling from the bees made honey in the darkened cubicle, waiting for another musky man-pole to probe its way through the light to go mushroom hunting with me
    <failo> I bet all drug users keep a human skull on their myspace page.
    <failo> Earle: everybody's gay for a prison system in which millions of our descendants murder each other in prison.
    <failo> Either you're gay or associated with all drugs.
    <failo> The war on polarbears is going to cum buckets into my gaping /dev/null.

I'm afraid these results say more about the quality of conversation in this
channel than they do about anything else...
